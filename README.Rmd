# Testing

## Using Bootstrap

Using R Markdown, the default behavior is to include the Bootstrap framework. This can make things very easy for you to signify your code and your output. Bootstrap defines some [CSS classes for backgrounds](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes-backgrounds): `"bg-primary"`, `"bg-success"`, `"bg-info"`, `"bg-warning"`, and `"bg-danger"`.

```{r df-drop, class.source='bg-warning', class.output='bg-warning'}
mtcars[, "mpg"]
```
